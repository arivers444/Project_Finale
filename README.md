## Baseball Hall of Fame Inductees
Established in 1936, the Baseball Hall of Fame (HOF) recognizes the best baseball players in the game. Inductees are selected each year, and join a Hall of Fame Class. The players selected join a caste of the best players and most noted names in the game and include more than 300 players.

## Overview
The goal of this model is to develop a model that is capabable of selecting the probable players based on player performance and awards. 

Each player that is selected for a HOF class is elected by commitee. Any candidate that meets the threshold of 75% of the comitee vote will be considered elected to the HOF.



## Data
Data for this project was pulled from seanlahman.com

The data is contained in a number of .csv file all of which are available fro the source website.

the specific .csv files used are:
1) HallofFDame.csv
2) Batting.csv
3) Pitching.csv
4) Fielding.csv
5) Awards.csv

## Expected outcomes
Machine learning model that predicts HOF players based on performance in batting, fielding pitching and awards.

## Questions to answer

1) Can the model select the appropriate HOF canditate.
2) Accuracy of the model overall
3) Does previous awards help identify players that may be inducted
4) Does player popularity effect the election results.
5) Does statistical performance predict candidates
