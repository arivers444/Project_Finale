Submitting ML Model
Here is the current Logistical Regression ML Model using Google Colab. We chose this model do to the binary answer we want. Was this player inducted into the Hall of Fame, yes or no? A Logistical Regression Model can analyzie statistics from the players career and give us the answer. The features we chose were batting, fielding, pitching and awards. The model runs at 80% accuracy at the moment. Which raises the question whether or not the machine is or were the humans inconsistant with merits on which the players were inducted into the Hall Of Fame. We investigate the data from the machine learning model to find the answer.
