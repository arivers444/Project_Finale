# Final Project

### Description of Communication Protocols:

#### Slack Direct Messaging
- Project team members will use an open platform for communication using a unique Slack direct messaging group.

#### Pull Requests
- Pull requests will initiate discussion about team member commits. Pull requests help start a code review and conversation about proposed changes before they're merged into the master branch.
