# Database
The database for this project is built in PostgreSQL using pgAdmin4

## Structure
The database was designed using the QuickDBD tool.  The ERD is shown below in Fig.1.  <br>
Due to the manner in which the data is provided in the various csv files, composite primary keys must be used in order to ensure unique row identifiers.
